# Todo: Table with the following/
- cols for contexts: VO iOS, VO Mac, Android TalkBack, Win JAWS?, Win NVDA?
- rows for events: start with increment, decrement, and dismiss

Platform call (with link to docs) and example gesure or key combo. e.g. For dismiss, on iOS would be a two finger scrub and UIAccessibilityPerformEscape
